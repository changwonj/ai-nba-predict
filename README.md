## Abstract

The National Basketball Assosciation (NBA) is a North American basketball league made up of 30 teams. Every year from October to April, the teams compete in a regular season tournament of 82 games each, in order to determine their seeding in the playoffs. The top 8 teams in each conference are placed in the playoff bracket, where the eventual winner is crowned the NBA Champion.

Like many sports leagues, the NBA tracks and records both team and individual statistics. These statistics range from simple statistics such as win percentage, to advanced statistics such as effective field goal percentage. Our group will use analyze data from previous NBA seasons in order to determine which of these metrics are the most important for a team to be successful in the post-season, and create a model that can accurately predict which team will become the next NBA champion.
